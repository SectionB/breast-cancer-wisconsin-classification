Using machine learning in to the winsconsin data set and predict whether the cancer is benign or malignant using different ML classifiers 

#Introduction

The malignancy of the breast cancer is the binary class problem to predict whether the cancer is
benign or malignant. In the given task was to make the same implementation stated in the given
research article and on top of that we had to try the given classifiers while enhancing the
accuracies of the models. 

# Dataset 

Original Wisconsin Breast Cancer Database
 699 Instance
 Missing values
 Number of attributes
 All attributes are Integer values between 1-10

# Models was used for modified Implementation.
o Support Vector Machine
o Naiive Bayes
o Linear Descriminant
o Distance to mean Classifier
o KNeighborsClassifier
o Fuzzy c-means
